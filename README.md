# Dough Formula Builder

## Formula App
Web app to allow user to create, save, and share dough formulas. Also provide users with helpful resources for 
baking bread and sourdough starters.

## Objectives
Most dough calculators I find online are either to simple to be useful or ugly spreadsheets so I wanted to make something I like using.


React/TypeScript frontend app created with Vite. Eventually some backend to save/retrieve user and formula data.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React + TypeScript

- TailwindCSS + DaisyUI

### Backend (to-do)
